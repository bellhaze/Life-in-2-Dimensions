Made for the GameDev.tv Game Jam 2023


The theme is Life in 2 dimensions, and we decided on a friendly slice of life 2D platformer, that also contains afterlife in the third dimension. Inspired by Super Paper Mario, you can press the tab or control key (or X/Y on controller) to transform the 2D world into 2.5D. Approach an NPC and you will greet them, brightening their day. Meet every NPC to hear a jingle indicating completion of the game.

This is the first game either of us have made and published and it was made in a week, so it is barebones with some issues, but we are proud to have gotten here! Let us know your thoughts.
